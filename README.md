Feature tests live in tests/Feature/AuthFlowTest.php. They cover:

  * OTP behavior (send/log, resend, throttle)

  * Register & verify email

  * Login (token issuance)

  * Profile (/users/me)

  * Selfie upload

Run all tests: 
```bash 
php artisan test 
```
âœ” Add a screenshot here showing all tests passing.

  * OTPs short-lived (5 minutes).

  * Selfies stored on public disk (/storage/selfies/...).

  + For sensitive use, consider private storage + signed URLs.
